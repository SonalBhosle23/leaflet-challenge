## Overview
This project visualizes earthquake data using Leaflet, a JavaScript library for interactive maps. The project involves plotting earthquake data based on their longitude and latitude, with data markers reflecting the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Popups are included to provide additional information about each earthquake when its associated marker is clicked. Additionally, a legend is created to provide context for the map data.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- **Leaflet-Part-1**: Contains the code for visualizing earthquake data.
- **Leaflet-Part-2**: (If applicable) 

## Setup
To run the visualization, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the appropriate directory (`Leaflet-Part-1` or `Leaflet-Part-2`) depending on the part of the challenge you want to explore.

## Data Source
The earthquake data used for this visualization is obtained from the USGS GeoJSON Feed. The data is updated every 5 minutes and is available in JSON format.

## Instructions
### Part 1: Visualizing Earthquake Data
1. Visit the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page.
2. Choose a dataset to visualize (e.g., "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days").
3. Use the URL of the selected JSON dataset to pull in the earthquake data for visualization.
4. Create a map using Leaflet that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
5. Adjust the data markers to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color.
6. Include popups that provide additional information about each earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
7. Create a legend to provide context for the map data.

## Example
Your visualization should resemble the following map:
